<h1>MS DOS Device Drivers</h1>

I've specifically put these files under '8 Bit Systems' as they were developed many years ago using an original IBM model 5150.
This used the 8088 (8 bit) processor, two floppy disks, and no hard disk.

These drivers were created for use with the Microvitec 702 Touchscreen monitor, and are an example of an early MS DOS TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) program.
